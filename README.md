## Installation



### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Coordinator into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby

platform:ios,"12.0"
use_frameworks!
target "Test"do
	pod 'MemoryChainKit'
end
```
And then please enter the command order as below
` pod install`
 And then close the .xcodeproj file and open workspace file.
 
 import MemoryChainKit in the place you want.

You must use direct link through `:git` since CocoaPods central repository contains a framework of the same name.[^1]

Any questions, please submit one issue and then I will modify and then extend the framework.
Thank you so much.
